    <h1> YOU DIED! </h1>
    <p> Edward was not able to wake up in time to help you. The horsemen catch up to you and watch
      you struggle to climb up. First they slit Edwards throat from ear to ear. You see them coming
      towards you to cut your had off. Without thinking it twice you decide to jump off the cliff and
      die.
