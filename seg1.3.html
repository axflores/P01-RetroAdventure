    <h1> Sword Fight </h1>
    <p> Thanks to a successful attempt of extracting the poison from Edward, he draws swords with you and fight
      horsemen! All those hours of training you had with your dad with swords has finally paid off. Not only are
      you defeating them, but it feels so natural and easy. Edward struggling because of his bite is still slashing
      his sword right next to you. What a battle!
