    <h1>Poision Removal </h1>
    <p> Okay, you have only seen this done once in your life, when you got bit by rattlesnake. Your old man
      was a trained professional in the search and rescue area. He took some deep breaths and began removing
      the poision himself. You have no idea how he did but decide to do it anyways. Hands trembeling you hold
      his neck and begin extracting the poision with your mouth. Edward is now more responsive. You hear noise
      from a distance.... its the armed horsemen!
