    <h1> Leave Edward as Bait </h1>
    <p> Right after leaving your best friend so you can survive is an instant regret. The most shameful
      decision you have made in your life. You have no choice no but to keep running and hope they dont
      they don't get you. You can hear Edward fighting them and screaming in pain. Suddenly, no more
      screaming and no more noise. You make it out the forest and live with this regret the rest of your
      life.
   </p>
