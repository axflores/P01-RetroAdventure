    <h1> Intro to Edwards Story </h1>
  <p> Edward, your best friend and you were out in one of the many forests in Canada. Suddenly he gets attacked by a Goblin.
    You are not able to do anything because you were hit first to the ground. Blurry eyes, heart pounding, you are able to
    get a glance what the Goblin does. Returning to concious, you see a huge green mark on Edwards neck. At this point you
    have two life changing choices.
